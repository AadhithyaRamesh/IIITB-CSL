\maketitle

Visualization of small world networks is challenging owing
to the large size of the data and its property of being ``locally dense but
globally sparse.'' Generally networks are represented using graph layouts
and images of adjacency matrices, which have shortcomings of occlusion
and spatial complexity in its direct form. These shortcomings are usually
alleviated using pixel displays, hierarchical representations in the graph
layout, and sampling and aggregation in the matrix representation. We
propose techniques to enable effective and efficient visualization of small
world networks in the similarity space, as opposed to attribute space, us-
ing similarity matrix representation. Using the VAT (Visual Assessment
of cluster Tendency) algorithm as a seriation algorithm is pivotal to our
techniques. We propose the following novel ideas to enable efficient hier-
archical graphical representation of large networks: (a) parallelizing VAT
on the GPUs, (b) performing multilevel clustering on the matrix form,
and (c) visualizing a series of similarity matrices, from the same data set,
using parallel sets-like representation. We have shown the effectiveness
of proposed techniques using performance measurements of parallel im-
plementation of VAT, results of multilevel clustering, and analyses made
in case studies.

Our work has been published at BDA 2013 [1].
