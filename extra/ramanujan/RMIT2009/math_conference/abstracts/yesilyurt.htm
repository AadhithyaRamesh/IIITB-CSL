<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In a handwritten manuscript published with his 
lost notebook, Ramanujan stated without proofs forty identities for the 
Rogers-Ramanujan functions.<br>
Most of the elementary proofs given&nbsp; for these identities are based on Schroter-type 
theta function identities in particular, the identities of L.J.Rogers. We give a 
generalization of Rogers's identity. Applications to modular 
equations,Ramanujan's identities for the Rogers-Ramanujan functions as well as 
new identities for these functions are given.<br>
