<p><b><font size="2" color="#FF6600">GAME THEORY AND APPLICATIONS</font></b></p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#336799">Game theory offers an important tool to 
model, analyze, and solved ecentralized design problems involving multiple 
autonomous agents that interact strategically in a rational and intelligent way. 
It may be worth recalling here that the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for the 
year 2007 was jointly awarded to three game theorists Leonid Hurwicz, Eric 
Maskin, and Roger Myerson for having laid the foundations for design of games. 
Just three years ago, in 2005, Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann had received 
the Nobel prize for their path breaking work in game theory. In 1994, three game 
theorists John Nash, Harsanyi, and Selten had received the Nobel Prize for the 
pioneering work in game theory.<br>
<br>
Game Theory provides an important tool for solving many computer science 
problems as well. Examples of these problems include: design of decentralized 
algorithms involving selfish agents, design of sponsored search auctions on the 
web, Internet monitization, social network formation and analysis, design of 
procurement markets in electronic commerce, design of robust communication 
protocols, design of resource allocation mechanisms in computational grids, etc. 
An important emerging discipline, algorithmic game theory, which is concerned 
with design and analysis of game theoretic algorithms, is now an active research 
area. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#336799">The objective of this tutorial is to 
provide an introduction to fundamental notions and solution concepts in game 
theory and to get an exposure to some interesting applications of game theory.<br>
<br>
Topics that would be covered include:<br>
(1) Strategic Form Games<br>
(2) Dominant Strategy Equilibrium<br>
(3) Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium<br>
(4) Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium<br>
(5) Examples of Games: Matching Pennies, Prisoner's Dilemma, War and Peace, 
Tragedy of the Common, Climate Change, Bandwidth Sharing, etc.<br>
(6) Auctions and Mechanism Design<br>
(7) Application to Sponsored Search Auctions, Ad hoc Networks</font></p>
