<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The protein folding problem is a well known 
challenge problem in modern biology. It involves predicting the three 
dimensional structure from the sequence information, by minimising some energy 
function. Because of the difficulty of the general problem, researchers have 
studied folding in discrete lattice models. Even these much simpler abstractions 
have proved to be very hard. We survey the results on the computational 
intractability of folding in lattice models and some approximation algorithms 
for folding in these models.</span></font></p>
