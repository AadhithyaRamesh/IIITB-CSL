<font color="#245481" face="Times New Roman">In this talk we examine the problem of exact linear relations for the rank and 
the crank of partitions as well as the problem of congruence relations. This 
talk is in memory of A.O.L. Atkin and highlights some of his work. The first 
linear relations were found for the rank mod 5 and 7 by Dyson (1944) although 
the mod 5 results are encoded in an identity in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook. The 
first congruence relations for the rank were found by Atkin and Hussain (1958). 
Congruence relation for the crank of partitions are related to a PDE connecting 
the generating functions of the rank and the crank due to Atkin and Garvan 
(2003). We also discuss new congruences for the rank and the crank of 
partitions.</font></span></p>
