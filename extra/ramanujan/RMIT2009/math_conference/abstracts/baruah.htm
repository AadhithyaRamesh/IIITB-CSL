New hypergeometric-like series for 1/&#960;<sup>2</sup> arising from Eisenstein series and Ramanujan’s Cubic Theory of Elliptic Functions</span></font></p>

<font color="#336799"><span style="font-family: URWPalladioL-Roma">In his famous 
paper, “Modular Equations and Approximations to &#960;,” 
Ramanujan recorded 17 hypergeometric-like series representations for 1/&#960;. 
It was not until 1987 that proofs of all 17 series representations for 1/&#960; were found by Jonathan and 
Peter Borwein. These authors and several other authors in the past two decades 
have found many new series for 1/&#960; as well as for 1/&#960;<sup>2</sup>. 
Recently, the speaker and his co-authors B. C. Berndt and N. Nayak used certain 
representations for Eisenstein series and Ramanujan’s classical and cubic 
theories of elliptic functions to derive many new hypergeometric-like series 
representations for 1/&#960;<sup>2</sup>. 
For example, the series</span></font></p>
