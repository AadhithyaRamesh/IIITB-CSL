<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Perhaps Ramanujan devoted more research time to 
theta functions, including modular equations and number theory related to theta 
functions, than to any other topic.&nbsp; Since in the past five years mock theta 
functions have been in the forefront of research arising from Ramanujan's 
mathematics, and since Ramanujan's contributions to this subject were an 
outgrowth of his earlier work on theta functions, it perhaps would be wise to 
survey Ramanujan's work on theta functions at this time.</span></font></p>
