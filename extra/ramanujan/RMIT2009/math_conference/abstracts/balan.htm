<font color="#336799">This talk aims to introduce and discuss two models of 
biocomputing:<br>
DNA computing and peptide computing. We first give some preliminaries on DNA 
molecules, peptides and antibodies. This is followed by introduction to DNA 
computing starting with two seminal papers on the topic that created this new 
field: one by Tom Head on splicing systems in 1987 and the second one by Adleman 
in 1994 on solving an instance of Hamiltonian path problem using wetlab 
operations. We discuss about what prompted T. Head to look upon DNA 
hybridization as a computational model and then we proceed onto the Adleman's 
wetlab experiment to solve an instance of a Hamiltonian path problem. We present 
models to solve few more NP-complete problems using DNA hybridization as an 
operation. We will also study about various theoretical models defined in DNA 
computing such as splicing system, sticker system and self-assembly models.<br>
<br>
In the later part of the talk we introduce peptide computing as a model to solve 
some NP-complete problems - Satisfiability problem and Hamiltonian path problem. 
We also present two kinds of simulation of Turing machine using peptide 
computing model - one as a look-and-do method and the other as the one that has 
the transition table of the Turing machine encoded on the peptide sequences. We 
define an abstract model for peptide computing called as peptide computer that 
lead to understanding one of the basic question - what is a computational step 
in peptide computing? We also discuss few automata models inspired by peptide 
computing.<br>
<br>
In the final part of the talk we discuss the latest trends in these two fields 
and propose some possible solutions to some of the open problems present in 
these two fields.</font></p>
