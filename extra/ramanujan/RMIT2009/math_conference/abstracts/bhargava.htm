<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">One of Professor 
Venkatachaliegar’s favorites was ‘Ramanujan’s remarkable summation formula’ for 
which he found several applications and gave elegant, self contained proofs. 
More applications have since been discovered periodically. Also, as is well 
known, the remarkable formula has, as its special cases, many classical formulas 
of seminal importance in the theory of q-series and number theory. In this talk, 
I wish to present some more, what seem to be, new and interesting applications 
of the remarkable formula.</span></font></p>
