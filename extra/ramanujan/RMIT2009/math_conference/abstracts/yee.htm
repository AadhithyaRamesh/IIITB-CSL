<font face="Times New Roman" color="#245481">Parity has played a role in 
additive number theory, in particular partition identities from the beginning. 
In his recent long paper, Andrews began the thorough study of parity questions 
arising in partition identities. At the end of&nbsp; the paper, he then listed 15 
open problems. In this talk, we shall discuss several new discoveries of Andrews 
and provide answers to some of&nbsp; his open questions</font></span></p>
