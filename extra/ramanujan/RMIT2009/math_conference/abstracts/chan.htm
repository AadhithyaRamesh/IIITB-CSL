</font></b><br>
<font color="#245481">We first give an introduction to Ramanujan's 
mock theta functions. Next, we present two new mock theta functions of the sixth 
order that was discovered in a joint work with Bruce Berndt. We also present and 
sketch proofs of four transformation formulas relating the new mock theta 
functions with Ramanujan's mock theta functions of the sixth order from the same 
joint work. We end the talk with a discussion of related problems.</font></span></p>
