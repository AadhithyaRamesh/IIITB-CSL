<font color="#245481" face="Times New Roman">In his 1914 paper &quot;On certain 
arithmetic functions&quot; Ramanujan showed that the Eisenstein series on the full 
modular group satisfy a coupled system of nonlinear differential equations. His 
clever proof is based on the Fourier expansions for certain elliptic functions. 
Ramanujan's work has inspired a number of analogous differential equations for 
modular forms on subgroups of the modular group, including V. Ramamani's system 
for modular forms of level 2 and R. Maier's system for modular forms of level 2, 
3, and 4. I will discuss further generalizations, corresponding to differential 
equations for modular forms of level N. Consequences of these differential 
equations, motivated by results in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook, will be 
established. In addition, I will discuss preliminary work regarding the location 
and distribution of zeros for Eisenstein series on groups commensurable with 
SL(2, Z).</font></span></p>
